Spiral or Zigzag Tree traversal using level order traversal

We can go through the complete code. We have created 3 packages

1.) org.learn.PrepareTree : Under this package we are creating the tree (This tree we will Traverse).

2.) org.learn.Question: Under this question package, we will have SpiralTraversal class 
which is responsible for traversing the tree and print the elements in spiral form

3.) org.learn.Client: Under this package we have main function, 
where we are constructing the tree and then we are traversing the whole tree using level order traversal.
